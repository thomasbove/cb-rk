- `hcd {usb_host_t *}`: The USB host controller that should be used for USB transactions.
- `pbase {uintptr_t}`: The guest physical address of the device (2 pages)
- `virq {int}`: The virtual IRQ number for this device
- `vmm_ncap {seL4_CPtr}`: The capability to the endpoint at which the VMM waits for notifications.
- `vm_ncap {seL4_CPtr}`: The index at which to install a notification capability into the VM
- `badge {int}`: The seL4 badge which should be applied to the notification capability.
